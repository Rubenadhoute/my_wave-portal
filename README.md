# My first Ethereum dApp

WavePortal Website - just send me a ðŸ‘‹ .

The Wave is saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract and displayed on the website. 

P.S: There is a chance that you can win a small amount of ETH by just waving at me...

This project was completed in 2 steps :

1. Writing + deploying the smart contract (both locally and on chain).

2. Building the website that will let people actually connect their wallets and interact with the contract.


## Key Learnings

1. BuildSpace 

2. FE/BE connection- working with ABI.

3. Building a website that let people actually connect their wallets and interact

4. Events on Solidity

5. Smart Contract - "Internal transactions"
