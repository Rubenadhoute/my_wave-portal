# Wave portal

WavePortal Website - just send me a ðŸ‘‹ .

The Wave is saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract and displayed on the website. 

P.S: There is a random chance that you can win a small amount of ETH by just waving at me...

## Key Learnings

1. BuildSpace is dope

2. FE/BE connection- storing both contract address and its ABI on Replit

3. Building a website that let people actually connect their wallets and interact -- Replit is dope!!

4. Events on Solidity 

5. Smart Contract - "Internal transactions":

# Steps to reproduce 


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.
